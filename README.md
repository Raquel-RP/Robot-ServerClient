# Robot - Server/Client
Simmulation of a communication between client and server of a cleaning robot with his own designed protocol.

This is class project for the subject Web Application Development. I developed a protocol (object oriented) for a cleaning robot and then
simmulated a server and client for it. Both TCP and UDP communications are used with sockets.
